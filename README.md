# Genie AI Agents

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for Genie AI Agents, as used in Master Thesis SS25 (Kunjibettu). Genie represents an advanced, multi-capable AI agent system designed to augment human productivity through adaptive reasoning and collaborative workflow integration.

## Overview

* Genie AI Agents act as intelligent companions that:
  * Generate ideas and execute complex strategies
  * Adapt to user needs through continuous learning
  * Collaborate across tasks, projects, and teams
  * Integrate seamlessly with platforms like GitHub and enterprise tools

## Key focus areas include:

* Innovation, planning, and operational execution
* Validation and iterative evolution of agent skills
* Empowering users to achieve creative and productivity potential

## Repository Structure

`codes/` — Source code for Genie agents and interaction modules.
`dummy datasets/`  — Sample datasets for testing and demonstration.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository and set up a Python environment (Python 3.8+ recommended).
* Install required dependencies (see possible requirements.txt or notes in codes/).
* Run or adapt provided scripts to launch Genie agents on sample tasks.
* Review code comments and experimental results to understand agent behavior and benchmarking.

## Features

* utonomous code drafting, refactoring, and testing.
* Handles task assignments, workflow optimization, and context adaptation.
* Compatible with collaborative tools (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Jira) for broader team integration.
* Modular structure for further research, extension, and benchmarking.

## Research Reference

* This project supports the Genie AI Agents chapter of Master Thesis SS25, addressing the future of agentic AI:
* How agents learn, reason, and evolve with human collaborators
* Essential challenges in agent trust, transparency, and empowerment
* Benchmarks for innovation, adaptability, and collective problem-solving

Integration-ready for collaborative workspaces

Designed for research experimentation, benchmarking, and extension
